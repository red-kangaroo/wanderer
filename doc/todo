README
* story/very short lore?
* preview:
   https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/

* refactor player!!!
* fun colors for armor
* add <code></code> around instruction messages? (eg. Press '?', etc.)
* also would be nice if bumping into a wall doesn't cost you a turn since that's usually on accident
* make sure player doesn't start in lava or in a locked treasure room
   fixEntry // arrival vaults
   floodfill the level, add teleporters to all closed-off spaces and prevent player spawning
   what about closed vaults?

* stun
   both player and mobs
* invisibility - doesn't work against adjacent mobs, otherwise they ignore player no matter their aggro range,
                 unless they have esp (but then boss should loose esp, also prevent ranged attacks against invisible player)
* player haste - mobs only act on even turns (what about slow mobs? maybe nothing, all mobs act as slow)
* rage - player looses control, avatar attacks until status ends

* terrain that causes Stuck status, prevents move away with some chance
   quicksand: yellow , (yellow background??)

* run in direction command
* persistent messages
  * message history command
* game difficulty + New Game button ??

  plant lordship (some effect when trampling grass, nettles and brambles)
  sludge (cap damage taken at 1, but only when Poisoned)
  hyperspace (diagonal movement)
  druidcraft (walk thru trees??)
* staff
  sunlight - 20 radius light on dark levels (even though walls, unlike the FOV); stuns all/nearby enemies (range 5??)
  enslavement - Mob vs mob combat
  polymorph - can change mobs or features
* consumable: Scroll/Potion
  Convocation - blink mobs near
  Omnipotence - regenerates level
  Incantation of Rushing Waters - generate random lake centered on avatar
   * allow_weird_liquids

  Bloodlust - adds 10? Kills
  Dessication - removes all liquids on level
  timed bomb

   r(1000)<visited: map is maze level
   r(100) <disttoorigin: map is dark level (add simple FOV)

     * lava and mobs with „light“ always visible
* maybe refactor maps into worldData struct with map, name + other future stuff
* maybe more decorations based on name?
   forests have alternate walls:
     4  dark green coniferous
     8  light green leafy
     |  brown, dead tree
     %  bush
     .  brown, tree stump
   * vorpal and orbs can destroy trees (and grass)
   deserts with sand, quicksand
* statue of yourself:  8
   new statues var, when >0 add that many statues to all new maps
   +1 whenever you step on statue
   mostly just flavour, but has the potential to swamp levels

* vaults:

   https://github.com/crawl/crawl/tree/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/des
* arrival vaults?


Mobs
====
* boss bold and underlined - cannot do right now, because we replace letter with charAt
* maybe randomly spawn boss when entering new area with >1000 Self??

* special effects of some attack verbs?
   Freezes: stop Aflame

* AI routine
* add A*

* lava/liquids block mobs??
   lava doesn't block mobs with flame/lavapool flags, etc.
* add descriptions for mob abilities
* spawn extra monsters on . OR respawn monsters on .

* flags:
phasing
invulnerable to bump attacks, slow speed
antimagic - cannot be harmed with magic/when player under influence of magic
paralysis
stun - random movement
haste - move faster, don't attack faster

* behaviour:
pull close - if player is in straight unobstructed orthogonal line, pull d4 squares closer
dig
when near, create area of bad terrain around player
when near, create bad terrain in * pattern around self (2-3 sq long?)
ranged stun
