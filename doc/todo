README
* story/very short lore?
* preview:
   https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/

* refactor player!!!
* fun colors for armor
* add <code></code> around instruction messages? (eg. Press '?', etc.)
* also would be nice if bumping into a wall doesn't cost you a turn since that's usually on accident
* make sure player doesn't start in lava or in a locked treasure room
   floodfill the level, add teleporters to all closed-off spaces and prevent player spawning
   what about closed vaults?

* stun
* invisibility – doesn't work against adjacent mobs, otherwise they ignore player no matter their aggro range
* player haste – mobs only act on even turns (what about slow mobs?)
* rage – player looses control, avatar attacks

* lava and mobs with „light“ always visible

* terrain that causes Stuck status, prevents move away with some chance
   quicksand: yellow ,

* highlight mobs + treasure (Alt)
* highlight area 10 (green +) and score-1 (red +) away, to let the player plan their move
* switch findPlayer to highlight=""

* run in direction command
* persistent messages
  * message history command

   Normal
   Causal Crybaby - 1000 Self

* select from several fonts
* dark mode

* traps
   area teleport (random already visited, or anywhere?)
   explosion
   stun
* armor
  explosions (destroy adjacent mobs and terrain, but grants no kills)
  time mastery (randomly/on damage time stop)
  sunlight (once darkness is in, increases sight radius)
  water lily steps (immune to liquids, even beneficial effects)
  zen (no hunger and invulnerable while blind??)
  plant lordship (some effect when trampling grass, nettles and brambles)
  sludge (cap damage taken at 1, but only when Poisoned)
* staff
  Sunlight - 20 radius light on dark levels (even though walls, unlike the FOV); causes nearby mobs to flee (range 5?)
  Enslavement - Mob vs mob combat
  Polymorph - can change mobs or features
* consumable: Scroll/Potion
  Convocation - blink mobs near
  Omnipotence - regenerates level
  Incantation of Rushing Waters - generate random lake centered on avatar
   * allow_weird_liquids
  Four Humours - at diagonals if empty spawns water/lava/blood/sludge
  Enchantment of XX - specific armour glyphs, to let the player pick
  Genocide - remove all currCre
  Bloodlust - adds 10? Kills
  Dessication - removes all liquids on level
  timed bomb

* new generators
   r(1000)<visited: map is maze level
   r(100) <disttoorigin: map is dark level (add simple FOV)
* maybe refactor maps into worldData struct with map, name + other future stuff
* maybe more decorations based on name?
   forests have alternate walls:
     4  dark green coniferous
     8  light green leafy
     |  brown, dead tree
     %  bush
   deserts with sand, quicksand
* statue of yourself:  8
   new statues var, when >0 add that many statues to all new maps
   +1 whenever you step on statue
   mostly just flavour, but has the potential to swamp levels
* vaults:

* lava/liquids block mobs??
* add descriptions for mob abilities
* spawn extra monsters on . OR respawn monsters on .

* flags:
phasing
invulnerable to bump attacks, slow speed
antimagic - cannot be harmed with magic/when player under influence of magic
paralysis
stun - random movement
haste - move faster, don't attack faster
pull close - if player is in straight unobstructed orthogonal line, pull d4 squares closer

* behaviour:
teleport to player
teleport randomly
spawn / clone self
summon random
dig
explode when adjacent
summon
when near, create area of bad terrain around player
when near, create bad terrain in * pattern around self (2-3 sq long?)
