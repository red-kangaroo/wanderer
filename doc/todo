README
* story/very short lore?
* preview:
   https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/

* refactor player!!!
* fun colors for armor
* add <code></code> around instruction messages? (eg. Press '?', etc.)
* also would be nice if bumping into a wall doesn't cost you a turn since that's usually on accident
* make sure player doesn't start in lava or in a locked treasure room
   fixEntry // arrival vaults
   floodfill the level, add teleporters to all closed-off spaces and prevent player spawning
   what about closed vaults?

* stun
   both player and mobs
* invisibility - doesn't work against adjacent mobs, otherwise they ignore player no matter their aggro range,
                 unless they have esp (but then boss should loose esp, also prevent ranged attacks against invisible player)
* player haste - mobs only act on even turns (what about slow mobs? maybe nothing, all mobs act as slow)
* rage - player looses control, avatar attacks until status ends

* run in direction command
* persistent messages
  * message history command
* online scoreboard

  hyperspace (diagonal movement)
  invisibility
  druidcraft (walk thru trees??)

* staff
  sunlight - 20 radius light on dark levels (even though walls, unlike the FOV); stuns all/nearby enemies (range 5??)
  enslavement - Mob vs mob combat
  polymorph - can change mobs or features
  soaring leap passes thru mobs and attacks them?
* consumable: Scroll/Potion
  Convocation - blink mobs near
  Omnipotence - regenerates level
  Incantation of Rushing Waters - generate random lake centered on avatar
   * allow_weird_liquids
  Four Humours - at diagonals if empty spawns water/lava/blood/sludge
  Enchantment of XX - specific armour glyphs, to let the player pick
  Genocide - remove all currCre
  Bloodlust - adds 10? Kills
  Dessication - removes all liquids on level
  timed bomb

     * lava and mobs with „light“ always visible
* maybe refactor maps into worldData struct with map, name + other future stuff
* maybe more decorations based on name?
   forests should have alternate walls
   deserts with sand, quicksand
* statue of yourself:  8
   new statues var, when >0 add that many statues to all new maps
   +1 whenever you step on statue
   mostly just flavour, but has the potential to swamp levels
* terrain that spawn creatures around player, pentagram?

* vaults:

   https://github.com/crawl/crawl/tree/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/des
* arrival vaults?
* terrain that causes Stuck status, prevents move away with some chance
   quicksand: yellow , (yellow background??)
* fix rotate
* fix diagonal rivers

Mobs
====
* boss bold and underlined - cannot do right now, because we replace letter with charAt
* maybe randomly spawn boss when entering new area with >1000 Self

* special effects of some attack verbs?
   Freezes: stop Aflame

* add A*

* lava/liquids block mobs??
   lava doesn't block mobs with flame/lavapool flags, etc.
* add descriptions for mob abilities
* spawn extra monsters on . OR respawn monsters on .

* flags:
phasing
antimagic - cannot be harmed with magic/when player under influence of magic
paralysis
stun player
haste - move faster, don't attack faster
deal damage based on score, the higher score the higher damage

* behaviour:
pull close - if player is in straight unobstructed orthogonal line, pull d4 squares closer
dig
when near, create area of bad terrain around player
when near, create bad terrain in * pattern around self (2-3 sq long?)
ranged stun
