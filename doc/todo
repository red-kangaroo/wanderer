README
* story/very short lore?
* preview:
   https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/

* refactor player!!!
* fun colors for armor
* add <code></code> around instruction messages? (eg. Press '?', etc.)
* also would be nice if bumping into a wall doesn't cost you a turn since that's usually on accident
* make sure player doesn't start in lava or in a locked treasure room
   fixEntry // arrival vaults
   floodfill the level, add teleporters to all closed-off spaces and prevent player spawning
   what about closed vaults?

* invisibility - doesn't work against adjacent mobs, otherwise they ignore player no matter their aggro range,
                 unless they have esp (but then boss should loose esp, also prevent ranged attacks against invisible player)
* player haste - mobs only act on even turns (what about slow mobs? maybe nothing, all mobs act as slow)
* rage - player looses control, avatar attacks until status ends

* run in direction command
* online scoreboard
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31655085/database-on-a-personal-github-page
* select from several fonts
* dark mode

* traps
   area teleport (random already visited, or anywhere?)
   explosion
* armor
  explosions (destroy adjacent mobs and terrain, but grants no kills)
  time mastery (randomly/on damage time stop)
  water lily steps (immune to liquids, even beneficial effects)
  zen (no hunger and invulnerable while blind??)
  plant lordship (some effect when trampling grass, nettles and brambles)
  sludge (cap damage taken at 1, but only when Poisoned)
  hyperspace (diagonal movement)
  invisibility
  druidcraft (walk thru trees??)
* staff
  holy light - 20 radius light on dark levels (even though walls, unlike the FOV);
               adjacent mobs turned into mobAlly (follows as other mobs, doesn't attack player, instead if adjacent to mob, attacks them; Hope, Love, Truth, ...)
  enslavement - Mob vs mob combat (as above?)
  soaring leap passes thru mobs and attacks them
* consumable: Scroll/Potion
  Convocation - blink mobs near
  Omnipotence - regenerates level
  Incantation of Rushing Waters - generate random lake centered on avatar
   * allow_weird_liquids
  Four Humours - at diagonals if empty spawns water/lava/blood/sludge
  Enchantment of XX - specific armour glyphs, to let the player pick
  Genocide - remove all currCre
  Bloodlust - adds 10? Kills
  Dessication - removes all liquids on level
  timed bomb - maybe spawns mobs that explode immediately, but also gives timestop
  shadows - 333 turns of phasing
  escapism - tele
  distilled love - cure + score+50
  purity - cure + change all liquids on level to water
  logrus
* helmets
  * odd-numbered give extra Defense, even are magical

* new generators
   r(1000)<visited: map is maze level
   r(100) <disttoorigin: map is dark level (add simple FOV)
     https://heyjavascript.com/field-of-view-in-javascript-using-recursive-shadow-casting/
     * lava and mobs with „light“ always visible
* maybe more decorations based on name?
   forests should have alternate walls
   deserts with sand, quicksand
* statue of yourself:  8
   new statues var, when >0 add that many statues to all new maps
   +1 whenever you step on statue
   mostly just flavour, but has the potential to swamp levels
* terrain that spawn creatures around player, pentagram?
* unlocked doors

* vaults:
   https://github.com/caveadventure/incavead/blob/20beae583df9f7494e6ab2a77d375f4f5d5f4551/data/vaults.cfg
   https://github.com/crawl/crawl/tree/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/des
* arrival vaults?
* fix rotate
* fix diagonal rivers
* add X as iceblock spawn + water
* add m to that large room
* add consumables to i, plus can be declared as 2; move MacGuffin to something other

Mobs
====
* adjacent mobs follow player between levels
* prevent boss spawn when boss already present?
* passive attacks
* add cause of death msg
   Overwhelmed by XXX

* mobBoulder, maybe once persistent currCre is a thing
   immune to most attacks, instead pushed back
   onDeath leaves rubble
   behaviour when on liquid, plugs the pit, leaving just a .

* special effects of some attack verbs?
   Freezes: stop Aflame
* lava/liquids block mobs??
   lava doesn't block mobs with flame/lavapool flags, etc.
* add descriptions for mob abilities
* spawn extra monsters on . OR respawn monsters on . (blood drops?)

* flags:
antimagic - cannot be harmed with magic/when player under influence of magic
paralysis
haste - move faster, don't attack faster
deal damage based on score, the higher score the higher damage
invisible until >=2 squares away

* behaviour:
pull close - if player is in straight unobstructed orthogonal line, pull d4 squares closer
when near, create area of bad terrain around player
when near, create bad terrain in * pattern around self (2-3 sq long?)
reach attack
fix shooting
create ice blocks (blue X, stay in place, worthless)

Not Now
=======
* boss bold and underlined - cannot do right now, because we replace letter with charAt
* simplify mobOrb (not now, something is buggy)

* add A* (maybe not, current AI is dangerous enough?)
