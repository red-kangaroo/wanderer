* preview:
   https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/
* update commands

* refactor player!!!
* fun colors for armor/staff names
* add <code></code> around instruction messages? (eg. Press '?', etc.)
* also would be nice if bumping into a wall doesn't cost you a turn since that's usually on accident
* make sure player doesn't start in lava or in a locked treasure room

* lava/liquids blocks mobs??
* terrain that causes Stuck status, prevents move away with some chance

* maybe also highlight mobs/boss; treasure (Alt??)
* run in direction command
* persistent messages
  * message history command
* game difficulty + New Game button ??
   Normal
   Causal Crybaby - 1000 Self

* select from several fonts
* dark mode

* spawn extra monsters on . // respawn monsters on .
* make all enemies faster / as fast as player

* traps
   area teleport (random already visited, or anywhere?)
   explosion
* armor
  explosions (destroy adjacent mobs and terrain, but grants no kills)
  time mastery (randomly/on damage time stop)
  sunlight (once darkness is in, increases sight radius)
  water lily steps (immune to liquids, even beneficial effects)
  zen (no hunger and invulnerable while blind??)
  plant lordship (some effect when trampling grass, nettles and brambles)
  sludge (cap damage taken at 1, but only when Poisoned)
* staff
  Sunlight - 20 radius light on dark levels (even though walls, unlike the FOV); causes nearby mobs to flee (range 5?)
* consumable: Scroll
  Word of Convocation - blink mobs near??
  Omnipotence - regenerates level
  Incantation of Rushing Waters - generate random river
  Four Humours - at diagonals if empty spawns water/lava/blood/sludge

* orbs: one use step-on features with powerful effects
  * only in rooms, signs '1' around them explain their effect
  alternate reality - regens map

* new generators
   r(1000)<visited: map is maze level
   r(100) <disttoorigin: map is dark level (add simple FOV)
* maybe refactor maps into worldData struct with map, name + other future stuff
* maybe more decorations based on name?
   forests have alternate walls:
     4  dark green coniferous
     8  light green leafy
     |  brown, dead tree
     %  bush
   deserts with sand
* statue of yourself:  8
   new statues var, when >0 add that many statues to all new maps
   +1 whenever you step on statue
   mostly just flavour, but has the potential to swamp levels
* vaults:
