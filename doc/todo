readme
* story/very short lore?
* picture

* when copying tiles for display, set boss floor and spawn extra monsters each turn on boss floor??
* sign ! with random hint/lore; maybe only on starting map?
* shops that take energy for payment
* rooms should spawn with monsters

* traps
   summon adjacent monsters // monsters to adjacent (maybe lever?)
   area teleport (random already visited, or anywhere?)
* staffs
   xx
* armor
  * terror also gives immunity to player-side panic, once that status effect is implemented
  explosions (destroy adjacent mobs and terrain, but grants no kills)
  time mastery (randomly/on damage time stop)
  sunlight (once darkness is in, increases sight radius)

* new generators
   r(1000)<visited: map is maze level
   r(100) <disttoorigin: map is dark level (add simple FOV)

* sometimes levels don't use emptyBlock, but tileGrassShort or tileSand?
