* story/very short lore?
* README preview:
   https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/
* more hints

* move JS to individual .js file and use /* jshint esversion: 6 */
* just maybe look into disabling console? not that I'd expect cheaters, but...
   https://davidwalsh.name/disable-console
* put the description into a collapsible:
   https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp
* change keys for special display to something that doesn't interfere with browser shortcuts?

* refactor player!!!
* also would be nice if bumping into a wall doesn't cost you a turn since that's usually on accident
* make sure player doesn't start in lava or in a locked treasure room
   fixEntry // arrival vaults
   floodfill the level, add teleporters to all closed-off spaces and prevent player spawning
   what about closed vaults?

* invisibility - doesn't work against adjacent mobs, otherwise they ignore player no matter their aggro range,
                 unless they have esp (but then boss should loose esp, also prevent ranged attacks against invisible player)
* rage - player looses control, avatar attacks until status ends

* run in direction command
* online scoreboard
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31655085/database-on-a-personal-github-page
* select from several fonts
* dark mode

* traps
   area teleport (random already visited, or anywhere?)
* levers
   better secret paths?
   spawn sawblades?
* armor
   explosions (destroy adjacent mobs and terrain, but grants no kills)
   time mastery (randomly/on damage time stop)
   zen (no hunger and invulnerable while blind??)
   plant lordship (some effect when trampling grass, nettles and brambles)
   hyperspace (diagonal movement)
   druidcraft (walk thru trees??)

   sludge (cap damage taken at 1, all other damage becomes Poisoned duration)
   water lily steps (immune to liquids, even beneficial effects)
   invisibility
   cowardice - extra armor and hasted on hit when Panicked; fight-or-flight instead of paralysed?
* staff
   holy light - 20 radius light on dark levels (even though walls, unlike the FOV);
                adjacent mobs turned into mobAlly (follows as other mobs, doesn't attack player, instead if adjacent to mob, attacks them; Hope, Love, Truth, ...)
   enslavement - Mob vs mob combat (as above?)
* consumable: Scroll/Potion
  Convocation - blink mobs near
  tele adjacent away
  Omnipotence - regenerates level
  Incantation of Rushing Waters - generate random lake centered on avatar
   * allow_weird_liquids
  Four Humours - at diagonals if empty spawns water/lava/blood/sludge
  Enchantment of XX - specific armour glyphs, to let the player pick
  Genocide - remove all currCre
  Bloodlust - adds 10? Kills
  Dessication - removes all liquids on level
  timed bomb - maybe spawns mobs that explode immediately, but also gives timestop
  shadows - 333 turns of phasing
  escapism - tele
  distilled love - cure + score+50
  purity - cure + change all liquids on level to water
  logrus
* helmets
  * odd-numbered give extra Defense, even are magical

* new generators
   r(1000)<visited: map is maze level
   r(100) <disttoorigin: map is dark level (add simple FOV)
     https://heyjavascript.com/field-of-view-in-javascript-using-recursive-shadow-casting/
     * lava and mobs with „light“ always visible
* maybe more decorations based on name?
   forests should have alternate walls
   deserts with sand, quicksand
* statue of yourself:  8
   new statues var, when >0 add that many statues to all new maps
   +1 whenever you step on statue
   mostly just flavour, but has the potential to swamp levels
* terrain that spawn creatures around player, pentagram?
* "wilderness" maker, random floor/plants

* vaults:
   https://github.com/caveadventure/incavead/blob/20beae583df9f7494e6ab2a77d375f4f5d5f4551/data/vaults.cfg
   https://github.com/crawl/crawl/tree/master/crawl-ref/source/dat/des
* arrival vaults?
  * starting vault where player has no armour/staff, but vault has 1
* fix rotate
* fix diagonal rivers
* room refactor ended at 201

* more fun effects on altars
* morgue file in new raw window

Mobs
====
* adjacent mobs follow player between levels
* prevent boss spawn when boss already present?
* add cause of death msg
   Overwhelmed by XXX

* new boss, snake
   Xxxxxxx  - All Your Mistakes
   body parts are invulnerable, only head can be killed
   when head damaged, it will swap places with tail end
   random chance to get this or normal boss

* mobBoulder
   immune to most attacks, instead pushed back
   onDeath leaves rubble
   behaviour when on liquid, plugs the pit, leaving just a .
* mobCrystal
   crystal growth
   as ice block but procreates

* special effects of some attack verbs?
   Freezes: stop Aflame
* lava/liquids block mobs??
   lava doesn't block mobs with flame/lavapool flags, etc.
* add descriptions for mob abilities

* passive attacks:
bloody X bleed
counter
stun

* flags:
antimagic - cannot be harmed with magic/when player under influence of magic
haste - move faster, don't attack faster
deal damage based on score, the higher score the higher damage

* behaviour:
pull close - if player is in straight unobstructed orthogonal line, pull d4 squares closer
when near, create area of bad terrain around player
when near, create bad terrain in * pattern around self (2-3 sq long?)
reach attack
fix shooting
jump close from afar
jump kick attack

Not Now
=======
* boss bold and underlined - cannot do right now, because we replace letter with charAt
* maybe boss fight instead places artifact in the middle of the arena, teleports player and boss on kill creates many §, so that non-combat staffs can be used better

* add A* (maybe not, current AI is dangerous enough?)
